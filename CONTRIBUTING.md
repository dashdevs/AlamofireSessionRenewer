# Do’s and Don’ts

* **Search tickets before you file a new one.** Add to tickets if you have new information about the issue.
* **Only file tickets about the project itself.**
* **Keep tickets short but sweet.** Make sure you include all the context needed to solve the issue. Don't overdo it. Great tickets allow us to focus on solving problems instead of discussing them.
* **Take care of your ticket.** When you spend time to report a ticket with care. This will greatly speed up making changes to library.

## Bug Reports

In short, since you are most likely a developer, provide a ticket that you _yourself_ would _like_ to receive. Check if you are using the latest library version before filing a ticket. Also, please use project issue trackers to make sure your issue is not lost. 

## Feature Requests

To submit feature request you need to use project issue tracker. When approved, feature request should be added to TODO.md file.  Please try to be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it would related to existing features. 

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the **only** way to extend library functionality and fix issues in it. So when submitting PR please make sure:
* All enhancements and bug fixes need to be documented in the CHANGELOG.md file.
* All methods and classes are properly documented (using inline comments is preferrable way to do that).
* Make sure you have unit-tests for code you are contributing.
